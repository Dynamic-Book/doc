*The cash register is a boring computer designed for efficiency. The
Dybo, both software and hardware, wants to bring this efficiency to
teachers and students to manage their job of teaching and learning.*

Welcome to the Dybo documentation. It is structured in four categories
as described in the [documentation
system](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system). At this early
stage it is largely *Work-In-Progress*

* **[Tutorials.](1-Tutorials)** This is the documentation you want to
 read when first learning Dybo or to learn a very specific facet of
 Dybo.

* **[How-to Guides.](2-How-to-Guides)** These guides are step-by-step
procedures to resolve specific problems you may encounter with Dybo.

* **[References.](3-References)** Here is provided technical
  documentation on various facets of Dybo.

* **[Explanations.](4-Explanations)** To have a broader picture of
  Dybo and why this project, take a look here.
