These tools let you construct easily straight lines of all sort. They
can be resized or scaled to ease reading. When drawing a straight
lines, the user is not limited to the extent of the tool, the drawing
continues over the boundaries of the tool, in the same direction.

The protractor comes with a neat magnet feature. When constructing an
